First repository to get familiar with GitHub
# H1 Intro
Hello, my name is Abraham Gonzalez, I am born and still living in El Paso, Texas. My undergrad studies came from the the University of Texas at El Paso where I earned a degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in National Security.
I hope to become more familiar with GitHub to be able to use it on a daily basis.
